"@(#)mai2110c_read.me	1.1 09/08/03"
The program bpr2110c requires a semantic check during pre-compilation.
Tables are required to exist for this check to be successful. The tables are
created during execution and hence are required purely during the building
process. Hence two files are provided for this purpose, namely
bpr2110_tab_cre.sql and bpr2110_tab_drop.sql. These should be supplied as part
of the release in order that this program may be ported successfully and
re-linked on a custome rsite if neccessary.
